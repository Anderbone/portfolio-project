                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p> Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, China's population policy has undergone several major changes. At the beginning of the founding of new China, encouraging population births, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, a strict family planning policy was implemented, and gradually loosed after 1995[2], then two children are started after 2011. The total birth rate and natural growth rate drop from 33.43% and 25.83% in 1970 to 11.93% and 4.79% in 2011 respectively, then get a little increase to 12.43% and 5.32% in 2017, but still gives China one of the lowest fertility levels in the world\cite{yearbook2018national}. From figure 1 we could see overall the total birth rate and natural growth rate are drop down before 2006 and the curve tends to be gentle in recent years.</p>

                    <p>
Induced abortion is performed due to provocation from the outside by intentionally terminating an unwanted pregnancy. Although abortion has been used as a family planning method for many years, it is a problem for women's health, especially in rural areas of developing countries. These procedures are often unsafe due to poor medical conditions, and the impact on well-being, health situation of every mother and her family, even the whole social and country may stand for a long time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although there are no clear overall abortion data each year in China for public on Internet, and we can't simply draw the link between population birth rate to 'one-child' policy directly, the implementation of the family planning policy has significantly changed China's demographic structure, prompting China to enter the ranks of aging countries in a very short period of time, forming the whole country a characteristic of “not getting rich but getting older at first”[3]. In response to the socialization problems that may be brought about by the aging of the population, China’s population policy has undergone major adjustments in recent years. On December 28, 2013, a single child policy in which a couple who are only child in their family can give birth to two children is legally activated. Just two years later, in October 2015, the 18th CPC Central Committee decided, to fully against population aging, if one of a couple is the only child in his or her family, they could have two children legally. January 1, 2016, comprehensive two children policy was officially implemented.

                    <p>
                        Abortion data is often difficult to obtain, and the data accuracy is also difficult to guarantee. The overall birth ratio data online is impossible linked to the personal data of the abortion person, and therefore cannot be further analyzed and explained. Therefore there don't have too many research on post-abortion women considering their personal attributes.Results show that the more stringent
the abortion policy, the more likely married women are to have an induced abortion. Women become less vulnerable to enforced induced abortion during a loosened policy period[4].

                        Thankfully, the China Health and Nutrition Survey(CHNS) is an ongoing longitudinal large-scale survey[1], held for the first time in 1989, which led us to the factors behind abortion, as well as personal, family and community characteristics. The survey for pregnancy history are started from 1991 and there are 9 total waves up to now.

                    <h3>The Data</h3>

                    <p>
                        The CHNS survey has been conducted since 1989 there are overall ten times up to now. The latest release data on 2015 survey is just published on-line in May 2018. The survey uses a hierarchical multi-stage cluster random sampling principle. In terms of cities, choose provincial capitals and randomly choose medium-sized cities with poor economic development. In rural areas, the provinces are divided into three categories: high, medium and low. In the economic development level area, one county is selected for each advanced and low level, and two are selected from the intermediate level. In each city or county, four survey points were identified based on the principle of multi-stage cluster random sampling. The city attracted two urban neighborhood committees and two suburban villages, and the county established three villages where the neighborhood committee and county government are located[7]. The survey is divided into three dimensions: community, family and individual. The scope of the survey covers 12 provinces including Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Yunnan,Zhejiang and Guangxi, as well as three direct-controlled municipality including Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing.

                        This paper applies to nine survey datasets includes nine waves(1991,1993,1997,2000,2004,2006, 2009,2011,2015) except the first wave because some essential data we need are not included in early 1989 survey.

There are 41 data files including the topic of agriculture, asset, business, childcare, education, urban-index and so on. For this study 7 files including the most important 'ever married women', 'pregnancy history',and the factors related this study including 'education','health insurance','jobs','wages','urban' are chosen. Based on this detailed data, analysis of the relationship between post-abortion women and non-abortion women is possible.

Each file has many attributes in common, such as 'wave' means the year for survey,'IDind',a 12 digits number which represents a specific person, 'hhid' represents family ID, 'COMMID' means community ID. Based on same 'IDind' and 'wave', all files could be combined to study different factors behind the same person. Some 'IDind' shows more than one time in a file because it's a longtitude survey and same person could be visited in different waves.

For every specific topic(data file), there are many variables in it and a related document to explain the meaning of all variables and range of the variable value. The original questionnaires also could be found on CHNS website.
